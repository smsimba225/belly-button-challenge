# belly-button-challenge


This was an interesting challenge showcasing Interactive Visualizations!  It was interesting to see how simple it was to create charts for a large amount of data all at once. This exercise was also the first introduction to Javascript.  This language had always intimidated me, but with the background that we have acquired during this bootcamp, it was really easy to understand and implement.

Thank you for looking at my work!
